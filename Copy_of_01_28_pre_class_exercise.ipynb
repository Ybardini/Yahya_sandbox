'Strike one!' the umpire said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom teh benches black with people went up a muffled roar\\r\\nLike the beating of storm waves on a stern and distant shore\\r\\n'Kill him! Kill the umpire,' shouted someone on the stand;\\r\\nAnd it's likely they'd have killed him had Casey not raised his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n With a smile of Christian charity, great Casey's visage shone\\r\\nHe stilled the rising tumult, he made the game go on\\r\\nHe signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;\\r\\nBut Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said 'Strike two!'\\r\\n\\r\\n'Fraud!' cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered 'Fraud!'\\r\\nBut one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.\\r\\nThey saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain.\\r\\nThey knew that Casey would not let the ball go by again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;\\r\\nHe pound with cruel vengeance his bat upon the plate.\\r\\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go;\\r\\nAnd now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh somewhere in this promised land the sun is shining bright;\\r\\nThe band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;\\r\\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;\\r\\nBut there is no joy in Mudville -- mighty Casey has struck out.\""
